# BankAccount Encapsulation Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **encapsulation** in Java using a BankAccount management system. The `BankAccount` class secures account-related information by making all fields private and providing controlled access through getter and setter methods. It also validates balance updates to prevent negative values.

## Project Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Protects internal data by making fields private.  
- **Getter and Setter Methods**: Provide controlled access to private fields.  
- **Data Validation**: Setter prevents negative balances.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Multiple account objects demonstrate independent state management.  
- **Display Method**: `displayAccountInfo()` provides formatted account information.
